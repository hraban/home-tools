* Hraban’s Misc Nix Tools

Various Nix utility scripts for my nix computers.

* Battery Control for Mac (Intel and Apple Sillicon)

Use the =battery-control= nix-darwin module to control the maximum charge of
your battery.

Example:

#+begin_src nix
{
  inputs = {
    nix-tools.url = "github:hraban/nix-tools";
  };

  outputs = {
    nix-darwin
  , nix-tools
  , ...
  }: {
    darwinConfigurations = {
      MyHost = nix-darwin.lib.darwinSystem {
        # ...

        modules = [
          # Load the module here
          nix-tools.darwinModules.default

          # Now you can configure the actual module:
          ({ pkgs, ... }: {
            battery-control = {
              # (aarch64 only)
              # Use a clamping service to automatically turn charging...
              clamp-service = {
                enable = true;
                min = 10; # ON, when charge drops below this level
                max = 30; # OFF when charge rises above this level
                # "Charging off" means "maintain current level using power
                # supply", which is what you normally experience at 100%.
              };
              # Enable an xbar plugin to control the battery. On x86 this uses
              # BCLM and lets you select a “target charge” of between 50–100%,
              # while on aarch64 it provides a binary ON/OFF switch for
              # charging.  Requires xbar installed, of course, but also
              # home-manager.
              xbar-plugin.enable = true;
            };
          })
        ];
      };
    };
  };
}
#+end_src
